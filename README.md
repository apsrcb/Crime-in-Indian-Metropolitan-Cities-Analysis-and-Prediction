# Crime in Indian Metropolitan Cities- Analysis and Prediction


## Problem statement:

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict Crime cases in Indian Metropolitan cities using machine learning techniques, specifically the regression models and time series ARIMA models. The dataset consists of existing records of crime cases reported in the 19 metropolitan cities over the last five years, from 2017 to 2021 (data for 2022 hasn't been released yet).

The specific goals of this project are to analyze the historical crime data to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing crime cases in Indian metropolitan cities. Preprocess the data and perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization to identify patterns and minor details. Develop Regression models and time series ARIMA model to forecast future crime cases based on the historical data.

By leveraging machine learning techniques and time series analysis, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of crime dynamics in Indian metropolitan cities and contribute towards the development to ensure public safety and security.
